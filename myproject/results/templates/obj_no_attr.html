Template Trace: AttributeError: <1> object has no attribute <2>

Example Trace: AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'

Python Error Example:

new_list = []
"3".append(new_list)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#2>", line 1, in <module>
    "3".append(new_list)
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'

Python Error Fixed:

new_list = []
new_list.append("3")
>>> ['3']

TO-DO (currently for the user to do)
1) Search Python for <2> to see if there are any built-in python objects that
    have this method.

2) Search for similar attributes or functions that <1> has to see if perhaps a
    function has been misspelled.

It looks like your <1> object can't find the attribute or method <2>. This is
mainly due to two reasons, either your object is the wrong type (put in
suggestions of a new type here), or the attribute is misspelled.
